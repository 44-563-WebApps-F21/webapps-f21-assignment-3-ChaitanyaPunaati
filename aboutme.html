        <h1>The Rocketeer</h1>
        <p>The Rocketeer, American comic strip character created by writer and artist Dave Stevens in 1982.
            The character had its genesis in a backup story in Starslayer, a fantasy comic by independent
            publisher Pacific Comics. Drawing on the Commando Cody movie serials of the 1950s and pulp novels of the 1930s, 
            Stevens created the Rocketeer and his world as a beautifully rendered homage to a more innocent age.
